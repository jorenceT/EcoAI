To deer hunt we have to stop bor hunt and then reset it so doing default stop now need to resmove it later and try
the rest has to happen after bor is hunted

to stop 2 mill reducing one mill in deer hunt

reset seems working -> need to make rest after bor hunting before deer hunting
now the problem is doing 2 bor case any issue?


the belive condition should work but its having some issue the deer hunt is not getting triggered:
;(taunt-detected any-ally 14)
(unit-type-count-total villager > 20)
(building-type-count-total mill < 2)
(dropsite-min-distance deer-hunting != -1)
;(dropsite-min-distance boar-hunting == -1)
(or (dropsite-min-distance boar-hunting == -1) 
   (dropsite-min-distance live-boar > 70))
(up-remaining-boar-amount < 10)

setting old condition



belove code was good but for reseting while the first bor is completed we are going to use only HP check if HP low reset the hunting:
(defrule
  	(or (dropsite-min-distance boar-hunting == -1) 
   (dropsite-min-distance live-boar > 70))
   ;(up-remaining-boar-amount < 10)
=>
   (chat-to-all "reset after boar")
 (chat-to-all "first set")
   (set-strategic-number sn-enable-boar-hunting 0) ; Default 0. Means Deer hunting only (thus the Boar SNs take no effect), set to 1 once we start boar hunting and 2 when we finish.
   (set-strategic-number sn-minimum-number-hunters 0) ; Default 0. This is set later to increase priority of hunting (if 0 it will put it below forage and farming).
   (set-strategic-number sn-minimum-boar-hunt-group-size 0) ; Default 5. Alteredd below to be correctly 8 at the right time.
   (set-strategic-number sn-minimum-boar-lure-group-size 1000) ; Default 0. Altered below to be correctly 1 at the right time.
   ; Drop distance, 30 is a good default, most boar are set to spawn up to 22 distance away, and this adds a bit extra for wandering.
   (set-strategic-number sn-maximum-hunt-drop-distance 26) ; Default -1!
)
